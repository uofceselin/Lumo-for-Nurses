    let dataOfExercise = ["The Chin Tuck can help reverse forward-head posture by strengthening the neck muscles. \n\nThis exercise can be done sitting or standing. Start with your shoulders rolled back and down. While looking straight ahead, place two fingers on your chin, slightly tuck your chin and move your head back (image at bottom). Hold for 3-5 seconds and then release. Repeat 10 times. \n\nTip: The more of a double chin you create, the better the results. If you’re in a parked car, try doing the Chin Tuck pressing the back of your head into the headrest for 3-5 seconds. Do 15-20 repetitions.", "Stand with your back against a flat wall with your feet about four inches from the base. Maintain a slight bend in your knees. Your glutes, spine and head should all be against the wall. Bring your arms up with elbows bent so your upper arms are parallel to the floor and squeeze your shoulder blades together, forming a letter \"W\" (image at bottom). Hold for 3 seconds.\n\nNext, straighten your elbows to raise your arms up to form the letter “Y.” Make sure not to shrug your shoulders to your ears. Repeat this 10 times, starting at “W,” holding for 3 seconds and then raising your arms into a “Y.” Do 2-3 sets.", "This exercise loosens those tight chest muscles!\n\nStanding in a doorway, lift your arm so it's parallel to the floor and bend at the elbow so your fingers point toward the ceiling. Place your hand on the doorjamb.\n\nSlowly lean into your raised arm and push against the doorjamb for 7-10 seconds. Relax the pressure and then press your arm against the doorjamb again, this time coming into a slight lunge with your legs so your chest moves forward past the doorjamb for 7-10 seconds (image at bottom). Repeat this stretch two to three times on each side.", "Kneel onto your right knee with toes down, and place your left foot flat on the floor in front of you.\n\nPlace both hands on your left thigh and press your hips forward until you feel a good stretch in the hip flexors.\n\nContract your abdominals and slightly tilt your pelvis back while keeping your chin parallel to the floor (image at left). Hold this pose for 20-30 seconds, and then switch sides.", "This exercise helps strengthen your upper back muscles, especially the ones between your shoulder blades (the rhomboids).\n\nSit on the floor with your legs extended forward. Place the middle of the resistance band around the bottom of your feet and cross one side over the other to form an \"X\".\nGrasp the ends of the band with your arms extended in front of you.\n\nPull the ends of the band toward your hips, bending your elbows so they point backward (image at left). Hold and slowly return. Do 8-12 repetitions for three sets.", "According to a 2013 study by the Scandinavian Society of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, performing this simple resistance band exercise 2 minutes a day, five times a week, will significantly decrease your neck and shoulder pain and improve your posture.\n\nWhile standing, stagger your feet so one is slightly behind the other. Grasp the handles, or the ends, of the resistance band and lift your arms upward and slightly outward away from your body about 30 degrees.\n\nKeep a slight bend in your elbows. Stop at shoulder level; hold and return.\n\nMake sure to keep your shoulder blades down and back straight. Repeat this exercise for 2 minutes each day, five days a week."]
